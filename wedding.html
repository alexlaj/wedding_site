    <h2>Wedding</h2>
    <p>
      Our wedding ceremony and reception will take place on July 14th, 2018 at Raven Lodge, Mt. Washington Alpine Resort on Vancouver Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raven Lodge is at an elevation of 1,100 metres and sits at the eastern edge of Strathcona Provincial Park. The Paradise Meadows trailhead and an easy-access boardwalk loop begin next to Raven Lodge. The Meadows are truly a paradise in mid-summer, blanketed with colourful wildflowers, babbling creeks, and shady stands of old-growth forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slopes of Mt. Washington are best viewed from halfway around the loop. Whiskey jacks, Steller's jays, Douglas' squirrels and other cool critters frequent the Meadows. Guided nature walks for all ages and abilities are offered on summer weekends by Strathcona Wilderness Institute, departing from the SWI information centre next to the trailhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this elevation, weather can change quickly and without much warning.
      Mosquitos and horseflies are also common in mid-summer. Please dress for the elements and be prepared to embrace the bugs along with the scenery!
